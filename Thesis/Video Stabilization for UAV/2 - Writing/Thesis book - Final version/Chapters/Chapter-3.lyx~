In mathematics a projective space is a set of elements similar to the set
 P(V) of lines through the origin of a vector space V.
 The cases when V=R2 or V=R3 are the projective line and the projective
 plane, respectively.
 The idea of a projective space relates to perspective, more precisely to
 the way an eye or a camera projects a 3D scene to a 2D image.
 All points which lie on a projection line (i.e., a "line-of-sight"), intersecting
 with the entrance pupil of the camera, are projected onto a common image
 point.
 In this case the vector space is R3 with the camera entrance pupil at the
 origin and the projective space corresponds to the image points.
 Projective spaces can be studied as a separate field in mathematics, but
 are also used in various applied fields, geometry in particular.
 Geometric objects, such as points, lines, or planes, can be given a representat
ion as elements in projective spaces based on homogeneous coordinates.
 As a result, various relations between these objects can be described in
 a simpler way than is possible without homogeneous coordinates.
 Furthermore, various statements in geometry can be made more consistent
 and without exceptions.
 For example, in the standard geometry for the plane two lines always intersect
 at a point except when the lines are parallel.
 In a projective representation of lines and points, however, such an intersecti
on point exists even for parallel lines, and it can be computed in the same
 way as other intersection points.
 Other mathematical fields where projective spaces play a significant role
 are topology, the theory of Lie groups and algebraic groups, and their
 representation theories.
